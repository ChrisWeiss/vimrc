# vimrc.vim

This plugin replaces the lion's share of my `.vimrc`. It is a superset of [`vim-sensible`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible).

## Installation

```
mkdir -p ~/.vim && git clone https://github.com/sheerun/vimrc.vim.git ~/.vim/after
```

Your `.vimrc` should have following format:

```vim
runtime vimrc.vim

" Your code here...
```

## Features

* [compatible with vim-sensible](https://github.com/sheerun/vimrc.vim/blob/master/plugin/vimrc.vim#L5)
* [other additions](https://github.com/sheerun/vimrc.vim/blob/master/plugin/vimrc.vim#L127)
